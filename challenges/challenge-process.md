# Challenge Process

1. Start Challenge
2. Download starter files
3. Load starter files to frontend mentor directory
4. Read brief document, usually readme.md
5. Create bullet list for requirements
6. Read style guide, usually style-guide.md
7. Check figma design link if available - only with pro sub
8. Decide on extra challenges, libraries to use etc
9. Run Analysis, minimum 10min but take as long as needed, create analysis.md,
10. Review study doc tips for Frontend Mentor Challenges Tips
11. Update readme-template.md as you go and at end of project remove original readme.md and rename readme-template.md.

## Deployment

- Push to Frontend Mentor Github repo
- Deploy using GitHub Pages, might need to make my repo public to do so
- Create updated readme.md with What I did, Why I did it and How I did it.

## Frontend Mentor Challenges Tips

1. **Initial Analysis (10 minutes)**
   - Create a visual breakdown of the challenge by sketching the components
   - Color-code elements by complexity or type (structure, styling, interaction)
   - Take screenshots and annotate them with specific questions/challenges
   - List all requirements as single-sentence bullet points

2. **Chunking Strategy**
   - Break the project into "micro-tasks" that take 10-15 minutes each
   - Group related micro-tasks into "modules" (e.g., header section, card component)
   - Create a visual task board (digital or physical) showing all micro-tasks
   - Assign rough time estimates to each micro-task

3. **Execution Process**
   - Start with HTML structure for one component only
   - Move to CSS for that same component
   - Add functionality to that component
   - Only then move to the next component
   - Take a screenshot after completing each component for visual reinforcement

4. **Focus Maintenance During Implementation**
   - Set a timer for each micro-task (10-15 minutes)
   - After completing each micro-task, stand up and move around briefly
   - Use the "talk through" technique - explain what you're doing out loud
   - If stuck for more than 5 minutes, flag the issue and move to another task
   - Return to flagged issues after a break or at the end of the session

5. **Progress Visualization**
   - Create a "before/after" comparison for each component
   - Maintain a daily progress journal with screenshots
   - Use a GitHub repository with frequent, small commits
   - Create a progress bar or checklist that shows percentage complete

6. **Celebration Structure**
   - Celebrate micro-wins with small rewards (2-minute break, quick stretch)
   - After completing a full component, take a slightly longer break (5-10 minutes)
   - After finishing a full challenge, reward yourself with something meaningful
   - Share your accomplishments in development communities

7. **Template Creation**
   - After a few challenges, create your own template for breaking down future projects
   - Include starter HTML, CSS, and JS files set up the way you prefer
   - Build a personal library of components you can reference and reuse
   - Document your process so you don't have to reinvent it each time
