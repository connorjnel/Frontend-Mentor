## Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Paid version of Figma would be helpful to see code instead of design view.
- Semantic html takes a bit more thought to plan out
- Setting up CSS globals and variables took the longest, actual html was pretty quick for this one

### Continued development

- Semantic html use and best practices, need to stop using divs for everything

### Useful resources

- The god of all reference sites, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
